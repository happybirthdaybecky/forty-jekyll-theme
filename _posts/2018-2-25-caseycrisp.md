A few years ago, I had a conversation with Becky about how I was trying to select a print to buy from Minted.com to spruce up my apartment in DC.  I was spending hours just scrolling through all their prints, unable to make a decision on something that I thought would look good.  Her response was simple "Here's the thing Casey, don't worry about something looking good, just choose something that brings you joy."

Not only was that helpful advice for buying art, but I think it illustrates the way that Becky lives her life.  She seeks joy.  Becky doesn't just do what everyone else would do, she doesn't make decisions for other people.  She is true to herself and the joy she seeks is real-- it's following her heart as an artist, waiting for the love that she deserved, dancing with abandon, and investing fully in her friendships.  I feel so lucky that I get to experience Becky's joy and love as a friend.  She has challenged me to live a more authentic life and to focus on the things that really matter.  I hope that today, on her 30th birthday, and always- she will know what a special person she is.  And that I followed her advice and finally bought one of those prints.
