HAPPY BIRTHDAY you beautiful ray of light! I'm so ever grateful that you were born and that I get to be friends with you across(tic) many seasons! Here's to the best season yet - the third decade!

Booking it down to Meridian Hill Park and freestyle dancing at every red light is by far my favorite memory getting fit
Everyone who you've met has learned something beautiful about this earth from the way you take care of it
Creative and talented - the curiosity and intrigue you follow for projects and story telling is amazing I'll have to say
Kooky in the best way - like the I'll let you brush my teeth upon request kind of way
You are one of a kind, dear Becky, thanks for being born!

Happiest days to you - our worlds sure are brighter with you in it!

LYLAS,

Sarah
