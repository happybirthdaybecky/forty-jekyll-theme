Becky, it is such a joy to know you. It is extremely difficult to put into words the combination of joy, patience, wisdom and grace that you bring to a friendship. I feel so blessed to have had you in my life, to have travelled with you, and to have you be the standard-bearer of HuntsMylesMas. You are incredibly talented, and a remarkable person who it is a joy to celebrate and to be with. We do not deserve you (I mean everyone, in the world, when I say 'we'), and yet here you are, in our lives, by the grace of God.

I have just spent the evening playing volleyball with students, and so students are on my mind, and the way that I tend to process my relationship with students is to think about what steps I'm taking to point them towards the good things that bring joy and light to life and away from the many mistakes that I've made. It is my earnest prayer for every one of them that they make a friend who is as kind as you are, who are as sincere and un-cynical as you are, and who make them want to be a better person like you do for me and for everyone who is fortunate enough to have you in their lives.

I also sent you a Calvin and Hobbes, because in it Calvin asserts that it often takes some kind of catastrophe for people to enjoy the present moment. That seems untrue, I think you need the infectious influence of a friend who celebrates the present so fully that they'll pull a car over to capture horses in buttery light or a wooden sheep on the side of the road.

We love you and we celebrate you. Happy Birthday. Áfram Ísland!
