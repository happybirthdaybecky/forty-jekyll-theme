Becky, one of the great joys in life, and by necessity one of the great joys of growing older, is realizing the amazingness of someone you already knew. Furman being the lovely and small place it is, we certainly crossed paths but it wasn't until DC that we became friends. I consider myself incredibly lucky life led our paths back together. Without such fortuitousness, I never would have known what a kind, creative, and truly artistic person you are. It is not an exaggeration to say I often think of our friendship as a reminder that people contain multitudes. In many ways, this is obvious but most of life's big truths are obvious once you think about them. I hope this birthday is a little reminder of the delight, thoughtfulness, and energy you bring to all those around you both now and in the future. Hard to know where life goes next but I hope at some point it leads to more dinners, conversations, and book clubs with you.

Love,
Quinton
