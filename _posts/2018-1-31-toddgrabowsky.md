Dearest Becky,

First, a little poem for you. It's a kind of bittersweet poem, but there were things in it that reminded me of you so I love it.


<strong>Cloud Study</strong><br />by Donald Platt<br /><br />

I keep returning to John Constable’s <em>Study of Clouds</em>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oil on cardboard,<br />
six by seven and a half inches, it shows purple-gray<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thunderheads,<br />
one patch of blue, above low hills and two small trees flanked by shrubs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the left<br /><br />

foreground. A sketch en plein air, a half hour’s worth of work at most,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it catches<br />
exactly one scrap of sky and shifting sunlight on a blustery<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day in 1820.<br />
The year King George the Third died in Windsor Castle, blind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and insane, the year<br /><br />

50,000 Scottish weavers went on strike and printed a proclamation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calling for a new<br />
“provisional government.” Their leaders were caught, hanged, and then<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decapitated<br />
for good measure. This cloud study survived that history.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two minutes later,<br /><br />

the clouds would have taken on a different cast of light and shape<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just like the thunderheads<br />
now piling up above the Liffey. I hobble out of the Dublin City Gallery,<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take a bus to the river,<br />
sit on a park bench with a ziplock bag of ice on my swollen knee. Its wet cold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;makes the joint<br /><br />

ache. My body is breaking down, bone spur under the right kneecap.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At fifty-eight,<br />
I watch young men and women in black sweats run along the River Liffey —<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abha na Life,<br />
Anna Liffey, river that crosses the plains of Life. I envy them.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once I too could run<br /><br />

over the asphalt, almost without knowing I inhabited a body<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose knees might seize up<br />
and swell. I will not run again in this life. Cirrus and cumulonimbus<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scud across the blue<br />
escutcheon of sky. Sun’s blazon through rain rampant, my life is a cloud study<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for some larger landscape<br /><br />

John Constable never got around to painting. It hangs in a gilded frame.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People stare at it<br />
before passing on to more important canvases, to Renoir’s<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Les Parapluies</em>, women<br />
and men opening shiny black umbrellas in a Paris park.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There a mother shelters<br /><br />

her two daughters under an umbrella meant for one.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The younger daughter<br />
holds a wooden hoop she has been rolling along tamped dirt paths,<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whipping it with a stick<br />
to keep it spinning, before the rain settled in. Renoir painted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this small family<br /><br />

in his lush, impressionistic style. Five years later, after visiting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Italy and studying<br />
Piero della Francesca’s frescoes, he came back and finished the painting<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his new “manière aigre”<br />
or harsh style. He handled the gray silk folds of the auburn-haired woman’s dress<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the left as if they were<br /><br />

granite to be sculpted. She carries a market basket filled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the brim with shadow.<br />
To approach old age, one needs a new, harsher style. Here, by the Liffey,<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mothers push screaming<br />
infants in strollers. Five teenagers in blue jeans and bright yellow or green raincoats<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walk by, joking, texting<br /><br />

on cell phones, smoking. One girl and her boy hang back, embrace, French-kiss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a long ten seconds.<br />
Another boy shouts over his shoulder, “Get a room!” A pair<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of mute swans<br />
preens and swims down the River Liffey, whose amber waters mirror<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how the clouds pass,<br /><br />

avalanche of cumulus that hangs forever on the burnished<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unrippling surface<br />
of my memory — vast sky surf, cloud after cloud cresting, breaking<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be washed<br />
away to blue nothing. Each of us — lovers, mothers, runners, me — no more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than windblown swansdown.<br /><br />

When I read this poem, it made me think of our visit to the National Gallery to see the Gustave Caillebotte exhibit. I learned that he is one of your favorite artists and I locked that little gem away for future reference. I guess you could say it's bearing fruit now ;) We beheld his works. We discussed his art. And we ran into my coworker, Xavier, and his wife. And we bought sun paper and made sun prints. I confused you because I was so slow with my pursuit, but I hope it’s been worth the wait :)

That was before I knew how much you loved trees. But now I know and it’s one of my favorite things about you. I love discovering new things about you. It’s something I’m most excited about as we get older together. There’s an infinite number of things for us to learn about each other. And I’m excited to continue surprising each other with new projects and new adventures and new ways to love each other and love others and new silly voices and new games to play and new places to see. I know nothing is guaranteed, but wherever the future takes us, I’m excited to be tackling it together. I love you and I hope you know how very loved you are today and always.

Love forever,

Todd
