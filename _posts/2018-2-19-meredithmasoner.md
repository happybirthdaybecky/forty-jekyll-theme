Becky,

Itʼs fun to know that for our whole lives we will experience those milestone
birthdays together! It makes it easier to accept the change, and it helps me feel
close to you when weʼre far apart. One thing Iʼve loved about growing up is
realizing that we donʼt actually change all that much. At least not in the way I
imagined as a child. There are certain memories I have that are so real I can
literally feel the emotion from that memory. When I think about that, it seems
like no time has passed. I am betting itʼs no different when weʼre old. Lots will
fade, but those memories that stick will be with us always and keep our spirit
young! I remember getting baptized with you. I was so impressed because you
didnʼt have to pinch your nose with your fingers when you went under. When we
were 16, you told me that when youʼre turning left into traffic you usually go
ahead and turn with the car in front of you and pretend youʼre one long vehicle.
I think about that every time I am struggling to turn left! Makes me smile every
time! I have so many memories with you and, as silly as it sounds, I believe they
will help keep me forever young. Happiest of birthdays to the girl full of
compassion, joy, and determination!

Love,

Meredith Eades Masoner
