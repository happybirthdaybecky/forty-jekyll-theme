Cinque Terre

Way to Cinque Terre filled with gloom
Just east some bread, the sun will come out soon
hiking, swimming, and climbing cliffs, Oh My!
baby sweatshirt and octopus we'll try

Alana's lungs gave out on our steep route
salty aqua water is all about
hiking, swimming, and climbing cliffs, Oh My!
baby sweatshirt and octopus we'll try

Both picturesque in life and memories
friendly waiter, expensive french fries please!
hiking, swimming, and climbing cliffs, Oh My!
baby sweatshirt and octopus we'll try

ginger led us to shots with a french clan
kid's ticket fancied no euro tank man
hiking, swimming, and climbing cliffs, Oh My!
baby sweatshirt and octopus we'll try


Hi Becky,
What a beacon of light you are! You are a light that has guided me through the monotony of daily life, using your joyous spirit to turn them into grand adventures and sacred memories. You are a light that pulled truths from me and challenged me to be more authentic and honest. You are a light that has taught me to shine brighter into the dark corners, search deeper for answers, and love wisely. You are a light that makes all of your friends feel known, like life's ups and downs, mistakes and bewildering questions are normal and expected. And you are a light that teaches me how to love openly and whole-heartedly and I am so thankful we've been friends now for 15 (maybe 16???) years!! I am so lucky and fortunate to get to do life with you.

I love you so much and am so excited for the next 30 years!! Happy birthday Becky Lou!
