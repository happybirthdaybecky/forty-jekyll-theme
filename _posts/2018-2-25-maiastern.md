My abacus tells me Becky is entering her 30th orbit around the sun.
And you know what I love about Becky? I love how much Becky loves the stuﬀ that brightens her day and widens her eyes. She’s so passionate about natural light that now whenever I see early morning and late afternoon shimmers pouring in and casting shadows, I instantly think of Becky and her extreme love of light. Isn’t it beautiful that someone can love light so much?

I can’t ever think of Shake Shack without recalling her infectious laugh and joy while one time eating a mushroom burger and ice cream together. Don’t tell anyone but she thought she was ordering a vegetarian mushroom burger and when it was clear that the sandwich was actually just meat and mushroom together, she kept eating it.

Becky loves cookies and coﬀee too. It seems that whenever the mood strikes and it’s time for Becky’s afternoon re-up, I will drop whatever I’m doing at work just to take a stroll with her. It’s the daily afternoon cookie and coﬀee hunt and I wouldn’t miss it. I don’t drink coﬀee but I consider this to be my Becky re-up time, which leaves me feeling refreshed and gooﬁer, because why not?

I’m not sure how to even put in words how it felt to be a small part of her wedding day. And you know what a wedding is? It’s an outward celebration of the relationship with the person you love the most. And like I said before, I love how much Becky loves other stuﬀ!! And this includes her love for Todd. Being witness to her deep love for Todd and dreams of one day marrying him and living together on a houseboat is something I hold near and dear to my heart. It’s truly a special feeling to be an ear for Becky’s thoughts and feelings. And getting to document Becky and Todd’s big day was a beyond meaningful way for me to express how much love I have for her and her deep love for Todd. Love is just a big ol orbit around the sun isn’t it?

Thank you Becky for being such a wonderful human and making all our lives better because of your sunniness and passion. Love you lots. You go glen coco.
