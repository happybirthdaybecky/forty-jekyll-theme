Becky, you make me smile!  You are so joyful and full of life.  You radiate sunshine everywhere you go.  I love your carefree spirit and genuine desire to enjoy all aspects of life.  You are authentic, wise, enterprising, and gregarious.  I am blessed to have you as a friend.  You motivate me to be more spiritually committed and to go after my wildest dreams, as I see you do this in your own life.  Happy Birthday!
