Dearest Becky,

First, a little poem for you. It's a kind of bittersweet poem, but there were things in it that reminded me of you so I love it. I explain some of those things later...


<strong>Cloud Study</strong>

by Donald Platt


I keep returning to John Constable’s <em>Study of Clouds</em>.
  Oil on cardboard,
six by seven and a half inches, it shows purple-gray

  thunderheads,
one patch of blue, above low hills and two small trees flanked by shrubs
  in the left

foreground. A sketch en plein air, a half hour’s worth of work at most,
  it catches
exactly one scrap of sky and shifting sunlight on a blustery

  day in 1820.
The year King George the Third died in Windsor Castle, blind
  and insane, the year

50,000 Scottish weavers went on strike and printed a proclamation
  calling for a new
“provisional government.” Their leaders were caught, hanged, and then

  decapitated
for good measure. This cloud study survived that history.
  Two minutes later,

the clouds would have taken on a different cast of light and shape
  just like the thunderheads
now piling up above the Liffey. I hobble out of the Dublin City Gallery,

  take a bus to the river,
sit on a park bench with a ziplock bag of ice on my swollen knee. Its wet cold
  makes the joint

ache. My body is breaking down, bone spur under the right kneecap.
  At fifty-eight,
I watch young men and women in black sweats run along the River Liffey —

  Abha na Life,
Anna Liffey, river that crosses the plains of Life. I envy them.
  Once I too could run

over the asphalt, almost without knowing I inhabited a body
  whose knees might seize up
and swell. I will not run again in this life. Cirrus and cumulonimbus

  scud across the blue
escutcheon of sky. Sun’s blazon through rain rampant, my life is a cloud study
  for some larger landscape

John Constable never got around to painting. It hangs in a gilded frame.
  People stare at it
before passing on to more important canvases, to Renoir’s

  <em>Les Parapluies</em>, women
and men opening shiny black umbrellas in a Paris park.
  There a mother shelters

her two daughters under an umbrella meant for one.
  The younger daughter
holds a wooden hoop she has been rolling along tamped dirt paths,

  whipping it with a stick
to keep it spinning, before the rain settled in. Renoir painted
  this small family

in his lush, impressionistic style. Five years later, after visiting
  Italy and studying
Piero della Francesca’s frescoes, he came back and finished the painting

  in his new “manière aigre”
or harsh style. He handled the gray silk folds of the auburn-haired woman’s dress
  on the left as if they were

granite to be sculpted. She carries a market basket filled
  to the brim with shadow.
To approach old age, one needs a new, harsher style. Here, by the Liffey,

  mothers push screaming
infants in strollers. Five teenagers in blue jeans and bright yellow or green raincoats
  walk by, joking, texting

on cell phones, smoking. One girl and her boy hang back, embrace, French-kiss
  a long ten seconds.
Another boy shouts over his shoulder, “Get a room!” A pair

  of mute swans
preens and swims down the River Liffey, whose amber waters mirror
  how the clouds pass,

avalanche of cumulus that hangs forever on the burnished
  unrippling surface
of my memory — vast sky surf, cloud after cloud cresting, breaking

  to be washed
away to blue nothing. Each of us — lovers, mothers, runners, me — no more
  than windblown swansdown.

When I read this poem, it made me think of our visit to the National Gallery to see the Gustave Caillebotte exhibit. I learned that he is one of your favorite artists and I locked that little gem away for future reference. I guess you could say it's bearing fruit now ;) We beheld his works. We discussed his art. And we ran into my coworker, Xavier, and his wife. And we bought sun paper and made sun prints. I confused you because I was so slow with my pursuit, but I hope it’s been worth the wait :)

That was before I knew how much you loved trees. But now I know and it’s one of my favorite things about you. I love discovering new things about you. It’s something I’m most excited about as we get older together. There’s an infinite number of things for us to learn about each other. And I’m excited to continue surprising each other with new projects and new adventures and new ways to love each other and love others and new silly voices and new games to play and new places to see. I know nothing is guaranteed, but wherever the future takes us, I’m excited to be tackling it together. I love you and I hope you know how very loved you are today and always.

Love forever,

Todd
