Cinque Terre

Way to Cinque Terre filled with gloom<br />
Just east some bread, the sun will come out soon<br />
hiking, swimming, and climbing cliffs, Oh My!<br />
baby sweatshirt and octopus we'll try

Alana's lungs gave out on our steep route<br />
salty aqua water is all about<br />
hiking, swimming, and climbing cliffs, Oh My!<br />
baby sweatshirt and octopus we'll try

Both picturesque in life and memories<br />
friendly waiter, expensive french fries please!<br />
hiking, swimming, and climbing cliffs, Oh My!<br />
baby sweatshirt and octopus we'll try

ginger led us to shots with a french clan<br />
kid's ticket fancied no euro tank man<br />
hiking, swimming, and climbing cliffs, Oh My!<br />
baby sweatshirt and octopus we'll try<br />

Hi Becky,

What a beacon of light you are! You are a light that has guided me through the monotony of daily life, using your joyous spirit to turn them into grand adventures and sacred memories. You are a light that pulled truths from me and challenged me to be more authentic and honest. You are a light that has taught me to shine brighter into the dark corners, search deeper for answers, and love wisely. You are a light that makes all of your friends feel known, like life's ups and downs, mistakes and bewildering questions are normal and expected. And you are a light that teaches me how to love openly and whole-heartedly and I am so thankful we've been friends now for 15 (maybe 16???) years!! I am so lucky and fortunate to get to do life with you.

I love you so much and am so excited for the next 30 years!! Happy birthday Becky Lou!
