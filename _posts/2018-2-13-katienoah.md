Happy 30th birthday, Becky!!!! I can’t believe that you’re 30. Or that I’m 30 for that matter. I’m so thankful for all these years that we’ve had together. You’re a great sister and friend. I’m so happy that you get to start your 30’s being married to your best friend, Todd!!! I hope you have as much fun on this birthday as we had in these photos. Dance, sing, and stick your face in some cake!

We love you!!!
