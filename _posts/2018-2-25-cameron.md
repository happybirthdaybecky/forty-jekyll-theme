Beck:

I could write a novella about our friendship to celebrate your day of birth. But for now, I will keep it brief. I do this in the hope of soon being your DC neighbor. By the time you read this, I may know that one way or another…

Our friendship over the last few years has made me laugh, made me think, forced me to learn, and brought out the best in me. It has challenged me and pushed me; it has taken me to amazing places and provided me with iconic memories. I say our friendship has done that, but it would not have happened without you driving it—your curiosity, your creativity, your compassion and passion for the things you care about, and the selflessness with which you approach life.  

You make me laugh. You make me think. You force me to learn—about things and about myself. And you bring out the best in me. You challenge me and push me. And you have taken me to amazing places and provided me with iconic memories.

Thank you for who you are and for all that you do. I hope this year is the best year of your life. But I hope that knowing that the years will continue to get better.

As you settle into your thirtieth year—with your job and your husband and your cat and your houseboat—I hope you continue to invest in yourself, bringing out all of the talent and joy you have to offer the world.  

And don’t forget to appreciate the wooden sheep along the way.

Your friend,
Cam
