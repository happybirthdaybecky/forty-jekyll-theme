Roses are red, violets are blue
Without my Beck, I don't know what I'd do.

Happy birthday dear friend! I hope you have an amazing birthday and a blessed year ahead! You are full of wit, artistic talents, and always so fun to be around. I admire your passion to learn more, to recognize and share beauty, and to empathize with people around you. I love you lots, and wish I was able to join you on Friday!
