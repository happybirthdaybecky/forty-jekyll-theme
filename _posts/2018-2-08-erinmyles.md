Dearest Becky,

We are so grateful for your life. The world is a more interesting, beautiful place with you in it. In every interaction and conversation with you, we feel like we learn something new and see the world in a different way. Thank you for continually expanding our perspectives, for helping us love more deeply, and for encouraging us to seek justice more fully. You are a special person and deserve a special day. Dance your heart out!

With love,
Erin, Myles, and Forest
