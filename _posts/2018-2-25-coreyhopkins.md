I look at these shadow people every single day when I turn my computer on.   The Icefam trip was one for the record books (literally - pool count) and one that made a profound impression on my life.   I'm so glad you were a part of it and were able to document some of those special moments we all had together.

May this milestone year be full of adventure, wonder, and all of the good people you hold dear!

Cheers,
Corey
