Dearest Becky,

For 30 years you have graced the earth with beauty, joy, laughter, comedy, and creativity! Thank goodness there is a Becky Harlan in the world! How lucky I am to have met you and known you for the last 15 years! I've known you half of our whole life! That's pretty badass. You are truly one of the most wonderful people I know. Being around you makes me feel good. Selfishly, I like that! Selflessly, I'm so glad you have countless friends and family that also benefit from being near your glory. I wish you the happiest birthday and hope that 30 marks your best decade yet!! You are a fabulous friend-full of truth and grace. If you were bottled up the essence would be fresh spring grass and wildflowers. I would take that bottle with me anytime I needed a fresh scent of wildness and beauty and candor. THANK YOU for you friendship. Thank you for being exactly who you are. Thank you for allowing me to be a part of your life! Thank you for letting me be exactly who I am when I'm with you. That is a rare gift. HAPPY FREAKING BIRTHDAY!!! Thirty flirty and thriving! : )
